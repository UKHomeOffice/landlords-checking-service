- `CASEWORKER_EMAIL`= The address emails should go to on form submission
- `SUBMISSION_TEMPLATE_ID`= The GovUK Notify email template ID
- `PDF_CONVERTER_URL`= The URL that the html-pdf-converter service is running on

A full list of environment variables for extended local integrations can be accessed in the HOF team Keybase.
