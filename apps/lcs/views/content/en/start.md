All landlords in England must check that new adult tenants have the right to rent before starting a new tenancy. To do this, you should [ask to see relevant documents](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/right-to-rent-document-checks-a-user-guide). This [checking guide](https://www.gov.uk/landlord-immigration-check) can help you with this process.

You only need to check someone’s right to rent if their tenancy started on or after 1st February 2016 in England (or on or after 1st December 2014 if they are renting in Birmingham, Dudley, Sandwell, Walsall or Wolverhampton). Only use this service if you have tried to check the person’s right to rent by looking at their documents but need verification from the Home Office because:

- the person has an application or appeal outstanding with the Home Office
- or, the Home Office is currently holding the person’s documents

If you have problems accessing these forms or need help completing them, call the Landlords’ Helpline on 0300 790 6268.
